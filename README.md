Sage
====

Sage is meant to be a way to programmatically control the Dota 2 reply camera in an intelligent way. Note that the files here are extremely alpha i.e for demonstrative purposes only, so they may require a bit of work on your end to get working. The idea was to use machine learning to determine how and when the camera should move.
